<strong>Problem: 1</strong>  
Create a web application that takes student's enrolment number, name, age, course,
branch, contact, and email from web portal using a PHP script and shows that on a
web page. Extend the application to store the data entered through the web portal
portal into database (CSE2020). Once you have saved data to the database, read the
data through a PHP script and show it on the web portal. Further, extend the
application to show the data on web page in form of a neat and clean table with
dashed border for every row and column as shown below. Every row should have a
edit and delete button to update or remove a record from the database. When
clicking on edit button, it should open a new web page with all the data fields
already filled for corresponding ID. After you click delete button, a confirmation
should be taken to remove or cancel the record.

<strong>Problem: 2</strong>  
Visit - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos and parse JSON data to find
out the ID of all users those have completed minimum and maximum number of
tasks.

----------------------------------------------------------------

<strong>Problem: 3</strong>  
Visit - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts and do the following with
JSON data -
a. After running program user should be able to enter an input keyword of his
choice. In case user doesn’t enter any keyword, program should exit safely.
Enrollment Name Age Course Branch Contact Email Edit Delete
123 ABC 21 B.Tech. CSE 9897 cse@geu.ac.in Edit Delete

b. Once keyword is entered, you should find out the count of input keyword in
title and body of corresponding users. For Example - When user enters
“molestiae” output for user with id 1 should be -
1 1 1
1 2 1
1 3 1
1 6 2
Explanation - First and second columns show the ID of user and post respectively,
where third column shows the number of times a keyword appeared in that
particular user and post ID.
You should generate the output for all the users that are in JSON file.

<strong>Problem: 4</strong>  
This problem is taken from - Recruitment Test Part II for post of Software Engineer
at Smarter Codes -
Steps to perform in this problem :
1. Parse the JSON file
2. Go inside 'Body > Recommendations'
3. Print name of Restaurant
4. Go inside 'Body > Recommendations'
5. Go inside menu
6. Loop for each menu (there can be multiple menus)
7. Check whether type=sectionheader. If it is - go inside its 'children
8. Check whether type=item. If it is, check whether selected=1. If both are
true, print the name of item, and go inside its children.
9. Check whether selected=1 (no need to pay attention to the 'type' now
that we are inside children of 'item'). If selected was 1 then print the
name of child, and go further deep inside the children
Repeat the last step infinitely - until we have reached the deepest child
The output should look like this:
Restaurant1
--> Item1
-----> Child1
----------> Child1.1
----------> Child1.2
------> Child2
------> Child3
----------> Child3.1

Take note of length of arrows in each line above. Your output should also
contain these arrows to depict the indentation of each child.
Note -
A. Attached is the JSON file, named parse.json which you have to parse.
B. This video will help you complete the assignment - Parse JSON File

<strong>Problem: 5</strong>  
Guess The Number Game using JavaScript
See Instructions for Guess The Number Game (use guess.html file as a framework 
for the game and see the screenshots given below for reference.)
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Keep a record of guessCount. Start it on 1.
3. Provide the player with a way to guess what the number is.
4. Once a user submits guess record it somewhere so the user can see
their previous guesses.
5. Next, check whether it is the correct number.
6. If it is correct:
1. Show congratulations message.
2. Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses.
3. After that display control allowing the player to restart the game.
7. If it is wrong and the player has some guess counts left:
1. Display the wrong message.
2. Allow them to enter another guess.
3. Increment the guessCount by 1.
8. If it is wrong and the player has no guess counts left:
1. Tell the player that game is over.
2. Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses.
3. After that display control allowing the player to restart the game.
9. Once the game restarts, make sure the game logic and UI are
completely reset, then go back to step 1.
